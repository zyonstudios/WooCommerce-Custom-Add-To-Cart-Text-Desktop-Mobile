== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Will it work with my theme ?
The plugin inherits the styles from your theme. This means that the button size, font and color will be the same as the existing add to cart buttons in your store. The plugin will change the text without affecting the overall button styling.You should still be able to change the styles of the button via additional css on your theme.
